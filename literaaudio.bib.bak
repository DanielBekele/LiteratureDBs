This study aims to build up the psychoacoustic model, a kind of quantitative model, which could closely match the hearing mechanism. A good understanding of the sensory response of the human auditory system (HAS) is essential to the development of psychoacoustic models for audio watermarking, where the perceptual quality of processed audio must be preserved to the greatest extent.},

  abstract = {In high-quality digital audio coding, a great deal of attention is focused on the auditory perception process, as the goal of audio compression is to attain perceptually-transparent compression and reproduction. Consequently models for perceptual masking are used extensively in audio coders, allowing quantisation noise to be allocated in the various frequency subbands according to a masking function. In this way, quantisation noise can be made almost inaudible at the receiver. In this paper, the psychoacoustic phenomenon of auditory masking is described. This is followed by a review of the MPEG-1 (Moving Pictures Experts Group) international standard for audio compression, including an outline of the psychoacoustic models used.},
