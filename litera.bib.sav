  abstract = {Feature-based methods for non-rigid registration frequently encounter the correspondence problem. Regardless of whether points, lines, curves or surface parameterizations are used, feature-based non-rigid matching requires us to automatically solve for correspondences between two sets of features. In addition, there could be many features in either set that have no counterparts in the other. This outlier rejection problem further complicates an already difficult correspondence problem. We formulate feature-based non-rigid registration as a non-rigid point matching problem. After a careful review of the problem and an in-depth examination of two types of methods previously designed for rigid robust point matching (RPM), we propose a new general framework for non-rigid point matching. We consider it a general framework because it does not depend on any particular form of spatial mapping. We have also developed an algorithm—the TPS–RPM algorithm—with the thin-plate spline (TPS) as the parameterization of the non-rigid spatial mapping and the softassign for the correspondence. The performance of the TPS–RPM algorithm is demonstrated and validated in a series of carefully designed synthetic experiments. In each of these experiments, an empirical comparison with the popular iterated closest point (ICP) algorithm is also provided. Finally, we apply the algorithm to the problem of non-rigid registration of cortical anatomical structures which is required in brain mapping. While these results are somewhat preliminary, they clearly demonstrate the applicability of our approach to real world tasks involving feature-based non-rigid registration.},

  abstract = {Rigid registration of two geometric data sets is essential in many applications, including robot navigation, sur-
face reconstruction, and shape matching. Most commonly, variants of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algo-
rithm are employed for this task. These methods alternate between closest point computations to establish cor-
respondences between two data sets, and solving for the optimal transformation that brings these correspon-
dences into alignment. A major difficulty for this approach is the sensitivity to outliers and missing data often
observed in 3D scans. Most practical implementations of the ICP algorithm address this issue with a number
of heuristics to prune or reweight correspondences. However, these heuristics can be unreliable and difficult to
tune, which often requires substantial manual assistance. We propose a new formulation of the ICP algorithm
that avoids these difficulties by formulating the registration optimization using sparsity inducing norms. Our
new algorithm retains the simple structure of the ICP algorithm, while achieving superior registration results
when dealing with outliers and incomplete data. The complete source code of our implementation is provided at
http://lgg.epfl.ch/sparseicp.},
